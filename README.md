# Seismology-Python-Tutorials-SPT              
Our goal is to motivate Seismology enthusiasts to learn how to implement seismic methods through our projects using Python.



Our first tutorial is about acoustic wave propagation which consists of step-by-step Python codes.\
This tutorial is a good tool for seismology students who are eager to learn Python programming and code theoretical subjects.\
Part_1: How to creat and plot a source term.



Feel free to contact us. We will be happy to learn new things from you and share it with everyone for free.\
